# Android-Jetpack
A demo app using Android JetPack 2.0, with Java, to observe an activity Lifecycle. 


Android Jetpack has a lot of features. Inside the Architecture we can use Lifecicle observer to observe Activity lifecicles and act acordlingly. 



# Dependencies

I created this project with AndroiX support enabled, and then added the following libraries from jetpack.

```
def lifecycle_version = "2.0.0"
    implementation "androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-extensions:$lifecycle_version"
    // Optional : Kotlin extension (https://d.android.com/kotlin/ktx)
    implementation "androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-viewmodel-ktx:$lifecycle_version"
```
